# FSRCNN-lightning
This is not officially RepoÔºÅ
This repository presents a reconstructed implementation of the official FSRCNN (Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network) using the PyTorch Lightning framework. Key features include:

## Lightning Architecture:
The entire FSRCNN model has been restructured using the Lightning framework, offering a modular and scalable training loop that simplifies code management and experimentation.
## Distributed Training:
Enhanced with distributed training across multiple GPUs, ensuring scalability for larger datasets and faster convergence.
## New Data Loading System: 
Implemented an efficient and flexible data loading mechanism, optimizing the pipeline for handling various super-resolution datasets.
By leveraging the PyTorch Lightning architecture, this refactored version of FSRCNN improves code readability, scalability, and training efficiency.
